# Unit 1 Assignment

Your assignment for the first module will be to create a flowchart that represents the process of a random number guessing game. The game starts off by generating a random number between 1 and 100. The player then enters a number and is told if the number is too high, too low, or the correct number.

Here are the components of a flowchart.
